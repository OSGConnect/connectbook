Introduction to FreeSurfer on the OSPool 
====================================


## Overview

[FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/) is a software package to analyze MRI scans
of human brains. The OSG used to have a service called
Fsurf, which is now discontinued. Instead we have community supported 
FreeSurfer container image and workflow. Please see:
