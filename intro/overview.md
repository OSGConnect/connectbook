# OSG Quick Connect

There are two main ways to provide computing resources to the OSG. The
first method, which is appropriate for smaller sites or those that
cannot devote effort to deploy and operate the OSG software stack, is
called **OSG Quick Connect**. Here the access is provided through an ssh
account to the cluster, much like a normal user account.  Jobs from the
OSG virtual organization are delivered from a factory service provided
by the OSG Connect system. Once commissioned, very little manpower is
required to maintain the connection.

# HTCondor CE

The standard method is deploy the OSG software stack, the most relevant
component being the **Compute Element (CE)**. The method is based on
standard grid technology and is how the vast majority of OSG computing
centers deliver resources to users.  This is the preferred choice
for large sites aiming to support all of the virtual organizations
participating in OSG. There is more up-front learning to deploy this
software, but once operational the effort required to keep it running is
also minimal. In OSG we have recently developed a new version of the the
CE based on HTCondor.
