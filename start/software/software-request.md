[title]: - "Request Help with Your Software"

A large number of software packages can be used by compiling a portable installation or using a container 
(many community sofwares are already available in authoritative containers).  If you believe none of
these options ([described here](5000634395)) are applicable for your software, please get in touch with a simple email to
[support@osg-htc.org][support] that describes:
1. the software name, version, and/or website with download and install instructions
2. what science each job does, using the software
3. what you've tried so far (if anything), and what indications of issues you've experienced

As long as this code is:

1. available to the public in source form (e.g. open source)
2. licensed to all users, and does not require a license key
3. would not be better supported by another approach (which are usually preferable)

we should be able to help you create a portable installation with the 'right' solution.
