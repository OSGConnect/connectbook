[title]: - "Introduction to FreeSurfer on the OSPool"
[TOC]

## Overview

[FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/) is a software package to analyze MRI scans
of human brains. The OSG Connect service used to support a tool called
Fsurf, which has been discontinued for security reasons. Today, we support the official 
FreeSurfer container image and workflow. Please see:

* [https://github.com/pegasus-isi/freesurfer-osg-workflow](https://github.com/pegasus-isi/freesurfer-osg-workflow) - scroll down to see the documentation on this page.
* Container image: `/cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/osgvo-freesurfer:latest` and defined at [https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osgvo-freesurfer](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osgvo-freesurfer)

## Prerequisites

To use the FreeSurfer Pegasus workflow on the OSPool, you need:

* Your own FreeSurfer license file (see: [https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall#License](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall#License))
* A regular OSG Connect account.

## Privacy and Confidentiality of Subjects

In order to protect the privacy of your participantsâ€™ scans, users should only run
only defaced and fully deidentified scans for processing. The OSG Connect service has no support for HIPPA or other 'private' data requirements.
