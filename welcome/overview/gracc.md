To drill down on your own project and/or user, go to _Payload Jobs_.

Under the _Project_ or _User_ drop-downs, find your project/user. You can select multiple 
ones.

In the upper right corner, you can select a different time period. You can then select a
different _Group By_ time range. For example, if you want data for the last year group
monthly, select "Last 1 year" for the _Period_, and "1M" for the _Group By_.
