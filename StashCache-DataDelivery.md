[title]: - "StashCache: a Data Delivery Service for OSG"
[TOC]

## Introduction

StashCache is a solution under development which transparently caches data near compute sites.  It is available for beta testers.

The basic idea is one places data into an origin server (for OSG Connect users, this is Stash) and uses a command stash-cp within the job to access data from the remote site worker node.

## Usage

    stashcp [-d] [-r] [-h] -s <source> [-l <location to be copied to>]

    -d: show debugging information
    -r: recursively copy
    -h: show this help text

    --closest: return closest cache location

    Exit status 4 indicates that at least one file did not successfully copy over.
    Exit status 1 indicates that the WantsStashCache classad was not present in job environment.

## Overview of algorithm

All the functions are defined above everything else, so the code is not simple to read. STASHCP itself starts "running" after the comment line.

## LOGIC TO RUN STASHCP


### Startup
Before any downloading happens, STASHCP checks for relevant classads, loads xrootd, initializes information variables and processes arguments. It also determines the closest local cache.

### Classad
In order to make sure that StashCache jobs are only sent to those sites that can handle them, users are required to add a StashCache classad to their jobs: +WantsStashCache = true
If that classad is not present, STASHCP will stop, return 1, and print out an error message.
Note: This classad is not required if STASHCP is being run interactively, i.e., outside of a job environment.
Information variables
The information variables are shell arrays holding strings corresponding to the start and end times of downloads, as well as the file or folder name and the size. At the end of STASHCP, the information variables will be turned into strings and set as classads for the job. Right now, because HTCondor limits classads to 1024 characters, the strings are truncated.
When a directory is downloaded, the information variables will be updated as if the directory were a single unit - the filename variable will hold just the directory path, the size will reflect the size of the directory, and the download times will reflect the downloading time for the directory. This improves legibility and reduces space requirements. If a user downloads a directory mydir, the information variable for filename will hold mydir+. If a user downloads mydir/, the information variable for filename will hold mydir/+.

### Arguments
STASHCP only requires a single argument, the source. Every other argument is optional.
    -s <source> : <source> is the comma-delimited list of files and/or directories that the user wishes to download. The path of a given file will be of the form user/<username>/public/<path in STASH>.
    -l <location> : <location> is the location within the job directory that the user wishes to download their files/directories to. This can only be a single location. If the directory does not exist when STASHCP is run, STASHCP will fail and return 1.
    -d : if this flag is present, print debugging information.
    -r : if this flag is present, download recursively (all subfolders).

### Local cache
Simply calls setStashCache.sh and holds the result. The called code uses geoip information and the caches.json file to determine to closest active cache.

### Main Loop
This loop iterates over every file/directory that the user wishes to download. Each of these items is referred to as a source item.
Before any downloading occurs, STASHCP checks to see if the source currently being examined is a file or a directory. If the source is a file, doStashCpSingle is called; otherwise, doStashCpDirectory is called. The source item is downloaded to the user-specified directory. In both cases, a flag is set to indicate that the information variables are to be updated with respect to the source being downloaded.

### Location Logic
Due to numerous problems with trying to do this recursively, I decided to take a more direct approach and have STASHCP use the full source file path to direct location logic.
Simply speaking, STASHCP swaps out the prefix in the full path of the source item (the source prefix, denoted in the code as $prefixRm) for the prefix that the downloaded item should have in the job space). That prefix is set per original source argument in the main loop. The job prefix is a little more complicated, consisting of a base directory (the user-specified location) and a local path (defined as the source path with $prefixRm removed from the beginning). The $prefixRm and $baseDir variables are defined at the source level within the main loop, and the $localPath variable is defined individually for each file within doStashCpSingle or doStashCpDirectory. The ultimate command is this: xrdcp $xrdargs -f $sourcePrefix://$downloadFile $baseDir/$localPath
This can be better understood in the examination of a few different cases. In every case, the user-specified location is the home directory, and so $loc=. $sourcePrefix is just the location of the closest cache. The xrdcp commands are simplified for legibility.
The source item is a file user/jsmith/public/data.dat.

    $downloadFile = user/jsmith/public/data.dat
    $prefixRm = user/jsmith/public/
    $baseDir = .
    $localPath = data.dat
    Command: xrdcp $sourcePrefix://user/jsmith/public/data.dat ./data.dat
The source item is a directory user/jsmith/public/folderA, and STASHCP is downloading a file A1.dat from folderA.

    $downloadFile = user/jsmith/public/folderA/A1.dat
    $prefixRm = user/jsmith/public/folderA/
    $baseDir = ./folderA
    $localPath = A1.dat
    Command: xrdcp $sourcePrefix://user/jsmith/public/folderA/A1.dat folderA/A1.dat
The source item is a directory user/jsmith/public/folderB, and STASHCP is downloading a file beta1.dat from one of its subdirectories beta.

    $downloadFile = user/jsmith/public/folderB/beta/beta1.dat
    $prefixRm = user/jsmith/public/folderB
    $baseDir = ./folderB
    $localPath = beta/beta1.dat
    Command: xrdcp $sourcePrefix://user/jsmith/public/folderB/beta/beta1.dat folderB/beta/beta1.dat

### doStashCpSingle
This is where all the downloading actually happens.
This function can take two arguments. The first one, which is required, is the name of the file to be downloaded. If the second argument is present, the function will update the information variables with information about this particular file download. If the second argument is not present, no updating of information variables occurs (such as when the file being downloaded is but one member of a larger directory being downloaded).
doStashCpSingle depends on another script, downloading_timeout.sh for all timeout logic.
doStashCpSingle attempts to run xrdcp from the local cache, keeping track of start and end time. If this pull is not successful, a second xrdcp from local is attempted. Should that pull fail, STASHCP fails over to pulling from the trunk, and failover information is updated. If the final pull is not successful, failure information is updated. However, if any pull is successful, the usual information variables are updated. Furthermore, information about the successful download is uploaded to our Hadoop machine.

### doStashCpDirectory
Like doStashCpSingle, this function can take two arguments - the first is the directory to be downloaded, and the second is a flag to let the function know if it should update information. Information should not be updated if the directory being currently downloaded is a subdirectory of a larger directory being downloaded.
doStashCpDirectory iterates through the contents of the input directory. If an item is a file, doStashCpSingle is called on the item. If the item is a directory, and the recursive flag -r has been set, then the appropriate directory is created (look for the ## creating local directory for subfolder comment) and doStashCpDirectory is called on the item recursively. The time it takes to iterate and download all of the contents is recorded and, if appropriate, updated to the information variables.
Finishing
The information variables are chirped, as described above.
If any single download failed, STASHCP itself has failed. In this case, STASHCP returns 4.

### downloading_timeout.sh
This is a separate script that tracks the size of a file being downloaded, and cuts off the download command if the file's size does not change enough in a given period of time. This helps to tell the difference between a stalled download and a slow download.

    Usage: downloading_timeout.sh -t <TIMEOUT> -d <DIFF> -f <FILE> -s <EXPSIZE> <DOWNLOADING COMMAND>
    
The script waits until $file exists, at which point it stores $prevSize, the size of the file in bytes. Every `$timeoutseconds`, the script computes the expected size of the file using `$prevSize, $expSize and $diff: $wantSize := min($prevSize + $diff, $expSize)`. Thus, the script is asking for at least an increase of $diff bytes, unless $prevSize + $diff > $expSize. If the file size has not increased appropriately, the script shuts down the downloading command.
It is recommended that $timeout not be set to 1 second, as tests showed that download times varied on a second-by-second level. A better value is in the range of 3-10 seconds. These variables are set in STASHCP.

## Known issues and concerns
    Relies on GEOIP to find closest cache
        GEOIP doesn't always work
        Closest cache isn't necessarily the best cache
        No checking for "next-closest" cache if closest cache is temporarily down and status is not yet reflected in caches.json
    Call could be simpler, without requiring the use of flags for every argument
        Want: stashcp <FILE> <LOCATION> <FLAGS>
        Have: stashcp -s <FILE> -l <LOCATION> <FLAGS>
    Static hard-coded number of attempts to pull from cache (2) and trunk (1)
        Does not take type of error/failure into account
        If the closest cache is the trunk, then the algorithm will attempt to pull from the trunk 3 times, instead of 1 or 2
    Relies explicitly on the trunk being up in order to run critical steps
        In particular, relies on trunk being up in order to get size of file or to get contents of directory
        Could lead to unnecessary failure when the trunk is down but files are already present and accounted for on closest cache
    Does not do anything else if STASHCP fails
        Maybe if STASHCP from the local cache and from the trunk fail, should try wget? Hard to think of a situation when wget would work but stashcp from the trunk would not.
        Relatedly, STASHCP returns failure even if only one file isn't downloaded. We should consider breaking out of STASHCP immediately upon failure.
    Error messages are not informative for users
        Messages written only for the coder to use
    Hadoop messages still rely on timeout utility, which may not be available on all sites.
        On the other hand, the sites that don't have timeout are likely to be troublemakers in other ways, and would not support STASHCP for many other reasons.
    STASHCP assumes the following:
        The Owner ClassAd is present and not Undefined
        The ProjectName ClassAd exists
    STASHCP does not transfer files back from the worker node
    No record of whether the file was new to the cache it was pulled from or not
